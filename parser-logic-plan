Original input:
"open the mailbox with the pliers"
"turn the light on with the stick"
"look at the planet with the telescope"

Remove articles:
"open mailbox with pliers"
"turn light on with stick"
"look at planet with telescope"

Take first word as the verb:
verb = "open", "mailbox with pliers"
verb = "turn", "light on with stick"
verb = "look", "at planet with telescope"

Loop over remaining input, get first and second prepositions, then tokenize with prepositions:
prep1 = "with", prep2 = null, "mailbox", "pliers"
prep1 = "on", prep2 = with, "light", "stick"
prep1 = "at", prep2 = with, "planet", "telescope"


Now we have only objects. But we should also take into consideration instances
where adjectives are involved:

For example: "open the small mailbox with the rusty iron pliers"
Following the above steps, the tokenized input is:

"small mailbox", "rust iron pliers"

Compare to words in word table, return if any word is unkown.

Find the respective objects in the objectWord table and if more than one object applies to a word
that has been used by the user, score the objects in question by how many words reference it.

EXCEPTIONS:

Take the example "look under inside the mailbox".

When prepositions are stringed together like this before an object, only the first preposition,
in this case 'under' is considered as the one we want. Also, there cannot be more than two prepositions
in a command, so if the player added an extra preposition after 'inside' (for example), the parser would
return and tell the user they don't understand the command.
