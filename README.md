# azkii-prototype-2

TODO:

    array of array "lines" should be made into 2D array.

    the bit flags that the user enters into the spreadsheets need to affect whether the parser prevents the game routines from running.

        for example, if there is a sytax that states that the player can "attack [Actor] with [Weapon]", the player should not be allowed to attack if they specify different
        bit flags to the ones that are stated.

    parser should ask user to elaborate if their input matches some of the criteria of multiple syntaxes.
