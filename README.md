# azkii-prototype-2


NOTES & IMPROVEMENTS:

    Ask user to elaborate if parser unsure of input. For example, if they type "fight", the program should ask the user,
    "fight what?"

    Objects can have values that relate to their bit flags. For example, a container needs a capacity value.

    Users cannot add objects with synonyms or adjectives if the object has no flags.

    Parser must be able to handle input such as "take the leaflet and put it in the mailbox". Notice how the word 'it' is used.
